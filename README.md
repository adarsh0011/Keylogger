The project demonstrates the basic functionality of a keylogger, capturing keystrokes on a computer and potentially storing or transmitting this information for analysis.

Key Features:

Keystroke Capture: Captures keyboard inputs in real-time, allowing for tracking of user actions on a system.
Data Storage: Offers options for storing logged data, potentially with mechanisms to store locally or transmit to a remote server.
Customization: Provides flexibility to adjust the keylogging behavior based on the use case or security requirements.
Educational Purpose:
This repository serves as a learning resource for those interested in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. It was created in a controlled environment as part of an internship program to understand how keyloggers operate and to gain insights into potential security risks.

Disclaimer:
The keylogger in this repository is intended strictly for educational purposes and cybersecurity training. Misuse or deployment in unauthorized environments may be illegal and unethical. Users are responsible for ensuring they comply with all applicable laws and ethical guidelines when using this code.

NOTE:- To enhance the functionality of your keylogger project, consider including the pynput library in the same directory as your project files.
